# Towry's hand crafted NeoVim config

## Features

- Works without plugins.
- Lazy load plugins.
- Works well with monorepo projects (Search files, folders etc).

## TODO

- [ ] Improve format.
- [ ] Remeber last edited window and buffer.
- [ ] refactor the `userlib.ui.dropdown` to use telescope-ui-select extension.

## Commands

### `PrebundlePlugins`

will bundle all files inside `user.plugins` to a single file `user.plugins_bundle`

## FYI

- If there is something wrong with treesitter, try run `TSUpdate`.
